//Edit anything
After setting up work environment according to CONTRIBUTING.md
First edit TimeLineJS3/source code or whatever you are looking to do
Go into virtualenv by $workon TimeLineJS3
then $fab build   //This compiles your changes into TimeLineJS3/build
Now you can check changes against TimeLineJS3/history_of_everything.html
to get out of virtualenv: $deactivate

//history_of_everything can't be in compiled or example folder due to cross-site policy

//Open history of everything
run docsToJSON.sh to import google docs changes into JSON file (overwrites!)
